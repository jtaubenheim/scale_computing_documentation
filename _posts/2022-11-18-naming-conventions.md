The creation of new documentation within the file structure should adhere to the following naming conventions:

1. Date of creation (YYYY-MM-DD)

2. Name of module (e.g. sctool, scaled, etc.)

3. Sub-module (e.g. "VMCreateCommand", "CPUInfo", etc.)

4. Name of author

EXAMPLE: "2022-12-01-sctool-VMCreateCommand-JoshTaubenheim"
